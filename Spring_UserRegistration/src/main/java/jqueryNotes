JQuery
1. JQuery is a Javascript framework that makes working with Javascript much easier 
2. Everything in JQuery starts with a $ symbol 
3. Example of how JQuery simplifies Javascript code, here is what you need to do to 
   access
   a field called id in HTML:
	a. document.getElementById("userId") - Javascript
	b. ${"userId"} - JQuery
4. To make an AJAX call with JQuery:
	a. $.ajax({
                    url: "" <- the server url the ajax call will hit given a user 
                    request
		    data:{key:value}  <- data to send back to user as response (JSON)
                    success:function(){} <- will be executed when the response gets 
                    to browser
